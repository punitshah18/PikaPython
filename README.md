# Pokemon-Python-RPG

Developed a 703 line text-based RPG with Repl.it in Python 3 using two libraries

Utilized the time library to have the terminal narrate each line with a one-second delay and the random library to simulate Pokemon battles

Programmed ASCII figures of Pok√© Balls, Pikachu and hangman
